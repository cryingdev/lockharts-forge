## 🔄 Recent Updates (v0.1.32)

*   **Fluid Header Layout**: Optimized the Header UI to make the Journal (Log Ticker) variable in width, pushing essential stats and date information to the edges.
*   **Global UI Protections**: 
    *   Disabled context menus (long-press/right-click) and text selection globally to provide a seamless "app-like" experience.
    *   Blocked element dragging to prevent accidental browser interactions during gameplay.
